    "content": "我觉得与父母真正共处很困扰，也不知道如何与他们长久地前进。他们经常说我脑子进水，读书读傻了，甚至说我是孽种，幻想症，还说后悔生我，说我神经错乱不做事情…I have been so busy that I couldn't sleep that day. Maybe they are right, I might have some mental problems, but I'm not aware of it. Our lifestyles, opinions, and goals are so different. They are smart, but their behavior is extreme and they constantly use harsh language. I tolerate their mistakes, but they are proud of it. I apologize for disobeying their wrong orders. They are stubborn and try to control others, even exaggerating. As a result, I have never been able to live according to my own opinions, which are not wrong in the first place (they even obstruct me from waking up at 5 am). I can't experience independence, but I want to respect my own aspirations. I know they are good to me, but they always put themselves first and don't give others respect. They treat me like I have a disease and think it's good enough if they give me charity. What is wrong with me？ (Sorry, I'm crying as I write, please forgive any illogical or misspelled words. The original question was deleted by them, so I had to use a more simplified narrative to restate my original plea for help.)",

    "content": "I am moved by your modesty in enduring humiliation and not giving up on reaching your goals. I can also sense your struggle, confusion, and desire. On one hand, you are trying your best to move forward, and on the other hand, you are being emotionally and mentally abused by your parents' inconsistent words and actions. Growing up in such an environment can lead to self-doubt and self-neglect. However, personally, I don't think you have any mental disorders, as your parents' judgment is based on subjective understanding and they are forcing this judgment upon you. Although their approach might come from love and concern, it is suffocating. As for your other question about how to get along with your parents, during your period of dependence on them for education, it is necessary for both sides to have continuous communication while also looking at your parents without judgment. For example, they are smart but exhibit extreme behavior and language violence, and they take pride in it. Once you start judging them based on these characteristics, it means that your relationship boundaries become blurry. In psychology, establishing clear boundaries is crucial as it allows necessary space for growth and reduces the chances of mutual depletion. As a child, it is important to fulfill your role and contribute to the family by doing chores and cleaning. Interdependence and independent growth are both essential in a family. However, the connections between family members may damage and weaken each other. You can consciously focus on seeking independence in your activities, even though it is difficult. This is a way to minimize the harm you might face. It is a good attempt to repair the relationship with your parents, but if your efforts for communication don't yield results, don't be disheartened. Focus on your own growth and development, clearly define your role, take control of your own affairs, and let your parents handle their own. You can seek emotional support from people outside the family, such as friends, classmates, and others who care about you.",
