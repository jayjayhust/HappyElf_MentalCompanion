Given the demand of some users, here are some supplementary materials of PsyQA.

Here are the code and the dataset which is the annotated part and is split into train/dev/test dataset. Our experiment adopts the setting as the split_dataset directory and we also provide the code to split the dataset. (The split can be distinct due to the random seed and the slight discrepancy between experiment-version and camera-version PsyQA dataset.

We believe our split method is not good enough and the result of the strategy identification based on context could be better.
